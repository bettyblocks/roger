defmodule Roger.Partition.Worker.Callback do
  @moduledoc """

  Provides hooks into the job execution lifecycle.

  Roger can be configured with callback modules for the job worker,
  which invokes functions on various places in the job's life
  cycle.

      config :roger,
        callbacks: MyWorkerModule

  In this scenario, the mentioned `MyWorkerModule` needs to *use*
  `Roger.Partition.Worker.Callback`:

      defmodule MyWorkerModule do
        use Roger.Partition.Worker.Callback
      end

  In this worker module, you can implement the functions `before_run/2`,
  `after_run/2`, `on_error/4`, `on_cancel/2` and `on_buried/2` to
  respond to job events.
